## Project Description

### Goal:

- An interactive and animative portfolio website to display web development, programming, and designing skills to potential employers.

### Theme:

- Minimalist vibe overall and dark mode but wanted it to be reinvented from scratch compared to the midterm project and to be more interactive, dynamic and fun to navigate through unlike the midterm's static website.

### Pages:

- Home Page (introductory page on general skills, interests, etc)
- Projects Page (collection of projects and can be clicked to learn more about it)
- Gallery Page (collection of photography)
- About Page (biography page about more specific information)
- Contact Form (popup modal)

## Other features

- Light mode on smaller screens
- Go to top arrow on every page
- Custom cursor for each page

## Skills/Libraries Used

- There are several GSAP animations used throughout the website
- JS, HTML, CSS general skills
- Bootstrap v5

## Challenges

- Using and positioning with GSAP and understanding the functions
- Sizing/Formatting when overlapping styles between Bootstrap, CSS, and Internal Styles
- Using Bootstrap's flexbox and container

## Notes:

- For Mobile version, optimum sizing is at 768px. The website will be in light mode instead of dark mode to indicate it's in the mobile media query.
- Please refresh when in mobile version because it can get a little weird.

## Future implementations

- LocalStorage to store name variable from Form submission so that I can greet them somewhere
- More animations with GSAP and using ScrollTo
- Adding interactive quiz on About Me
- Flow in dropdown menu instead of navbar (Reference: [Cool Dropdown](https://caffeinepost.com/))
- Exploding skills once button clicked (on home page)
- Work Experience Timeline
